# Lab 101: Document SAMCO with Bob

## Overview
Use Bob's **Ask** mode to read live QSYS source members from `SAMSRC`, generate program-level documentation, produce a functional business document, and create an architecture document with an ERD — all saved as markdown in the `docs/` directory.

**Duration**: 15 minutes  
**Difficulty**: Beginner  
**Mode**: 💬 Ask  
**Source**: `SAMSRC` library on IBM i (QSYS)  
**Output**: Markdown files in `docs/`

> ⚠️ **Lab 101 reads source directly from `SAMSRC` on IBM i** using `read_member` and `search_qsys` — for documentation purposes only. `SAMSRC` is never modified. From **Lab 102 onwards**, all source work uses the **local workspace** (your Git clone) exclusively — `SAMCOn` contains only compiled objects and database tables.

---

## Prerequisites
- Bob IDE with **IBM Bob Premium Package for i** installed
- **Code for IBM i** extension connected to your IBM i system
- `SAMCOn` in your library list (`n` = your team number)
- `SAMSRC` library accessible

---

## Step 1: Explore the SAMSRC Library (2 minutes)

**Switch to 💬 Ask mode** in the Bob chat panel.

**Prompt:**
```
List all source files in library SAMSRC. For each, show the source file name and its typical content type (QRPGLESRC, QDDSSRC, QCLSRC, QSQLSRC, etc.).
```

**What to observe:**
- Bob uses `search_qsys` to scan `SAMSRC`
- Returns a structured list of source file types and member counts

---

## Step 2: Generate Program-Level Documentation (4 minutes)

> ℹ️ In QSYS, member names are limited to **10 characters**. The member for `ART200` is named `ART200` in source file `QRPGLESRC` of library `SAMSRC`.

**Prompt:**
```
Read member ART200 from SAMSRC/QRPGLESRC.

Generate concise technical documentation covering:
1. Program purpose and display file used
2. The panel-step state machine pattern (panel, step01, step02 variables with values: prp/lod/dsp/key/chk/act)
3. Key business rules (VAT calculation, soft-delete with ARDEL field, article validation)
4. Files used (input, output, update)

Save as docs/ART200-documentation.md in the local workspace.
```

**What to observe:**
- Bob uses `read_member` with library=`SAMSRC`, file=`QRPGLESRC`, member=`ART200`
- Explains the panel/step controller pattern and business rules
- Uses `write_stream_file` to save `docs/ART200-documentation.md`

---

## Step 3: Generate Functional Business Documentation (4 minutes)

**Prompt:**
```
Based on the ART200 program and the ARTICLE, FAMILLY, and VATDEF members in SAMSRC/QRPGLESRC and SAMSRC/QDDSSRC:

Generate a functional business document for the "Article Management" business function:
- What the function does (business perspective)
- Key business rules (VAT, soft-delete, price management)
- Screens involved and their purpose
- Data entities managed

Save as docs/SAMCO-ArticleManagement-functional.md in the local workspace.
```

**What to observe:**
- Bob reads additional members via `search_qsys` and `read_member` on `SAMSRC`
- Documentation is written in business-friendly language, not technical jargon
- Saved to `docs/SAMCO-ArticleManagement-functional.md`

---

## Step 4: Generate Architecture Document and ERD (5 minutes)

**Prompt:**
```
Generate a full architecture document for the SAMCO application.

Include:
- Application purpose and business domain
- Program inventory by module (article, customer, order, provider)
- Service programs and exported functions
- Key business rules summary (VAT, soft-delete, order lifecycle)

Save as docs/SAMCO-architecture.md in the local workspace.
```

Then run the `/erd` command to add a live schema diagram:
```
/erd SAMCOn
```

**What to observe:**
- Bob queries `QSYS2.SYSTABLES`, `SYSCOLUMNS`, `SYSCST` to build the ERD
- A **Mermaid ERD** is generated showing tables, primary keys, and foreign key relationships
- Both architecture text and ERD are saved to `docs/SAMCO-architecture.md`

> **Tip**: Try asking inline: *"What is the panel-step pattern in RPG?"* — Bob uses `search_ibm_i_docs_with_rag` to answer without leaving the conversation.

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

- [ ] `search_qsys` listed source files in `SAMSRC`
- [ ] `docs/ART200-documentation.md` created with program-level technical docs
- [ ] `docs/SAMCO-ArticleManagement-functional.md` created with business-level docs
- [ ] `docs/SAMCO-architecture.md` created with architecture overview
- [ ] `/erd SAMCOn` generated a Mermaid diagram of all SAMCO tables and relationships

---

## Key Takeaways

- `read_member` + `search_qsys` read live QSYS source — no copy-paste needed
- `/erd` generates instant schema diagrams from the QSYS2 catalog
- Documentation saved to `docs/` feeds all subsequent labs

---

## Next Steps

> **From Lab 102 onwards**: source work is exclusively on the **local workspace** (Git clone). Bob reads and edits local files with `read_stream_file` / `write_stream_file`; `SAMCOn` is the build target. `SAMSRC` is never used for code modifications.

Proceed to [Lab 102](lab102-premium-fixed-to-free.md) — convert fixed-format RPG to free-form.
