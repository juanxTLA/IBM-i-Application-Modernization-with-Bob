# Bob and IBM i workshop (Premium Package for i)

---

## 🎯 Mission: Modernisation

### Your Mission

As a member of the **development team**, your mission is to modernize your application and development practices — from green screen to a collaborative **Git / VS Code era with DevOps automation**. You are part of a **team of developers**, all onboarded on IBM Bob, all working on the same application.
Relax, IBM Bob is here to help ! 

With Premium Package for i, source, system or application artifacts can live on the system or in your local workspace/Git — your choice. Take benefits of the **built-in IBM i modes, rules, skills, workflows, and optimize your productivity.**

**Key general principles with Premium Package for i (PPi)**: Source can live in the **local workspace** or in **source files in QSYS**. When using PPi, you can keep your files in QSYS if you want to, and use Bob/PPi as an assistant while your developers still use SEU/PDM. **Just because you can doesn't mean you should!**.
We really encourage you to move your source files to the IFS and git, and use QSYS when it makes sense.

## 🧪 IBM Bob with Premium Package for i : End to End Labs (SAMCO)

### SAMCO Environment

![alt text](pics/image-1ppi2.png)

**Key principle in these Labs**: Source lives in the **local workspace** only. `SAMCOn` (n = team number)contains compiled programs, service programs, and database objects — no source members. `SAMSRCn` contains source files of the SAMCO application. In the rest of the labs, compiled objects always target `SAMCOn`.

**💡 Important Note**: Throughout the lab, you can start a new Bob task specifying a scope (workspace) using the **"+" button** at the top of the 'IBM Bob' Chat view: **1.local** workspace, **2.QSYS (Library list)**, or **3.IFS**. Most exercises can be run in either scope with the appropriate preparation. The behavior of the tool will be slightly different: **experiment and decide!**

The SAMCO application and database have already been built in your `SAMCOn` library so initally you don't have to build it. During the lab, you may need to modify the source code, and if you wish, you can recompile it, here using the Tobi (makei) tool. Of course, in your day to day developer activity, other build tools or scripts could be used. 

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| **Source code** | Local workspace — your Git clone on your workstation (IFS-synchronized). **This is the only place source is edited.** |
| **Your workspace** | Your own clone of the shared Git repository — Bob reads and writes local files directly |
| **Compiled objects & database** | Built and stored in **`SAMCOn`** on IBM i — where `n` is your team number (e.g., `SAMCO1`, `SAMCO3`) |
| **Source Files** | **`SAMSRCn`** Libraries containing source members on IBM i — used **in Lab 101** for documentation generation and code understanding |

This collaborative setup means your changes stay isolated in your branch (and libraries) until you are ready to merge, while the rest of your team works in parallel.

## 🛠️ Lab Environment Setup

### a. Install & Start IBM Bob IDE

1. Download and install **Bob IDE** (VS Code-based).
2. Launch Bob IDE and sign in with your **IBM ID** — if you don't have an account, inform your instructor before the lab.
3. Install the **Bob Premium Package for i**  *(PPi `.vsix` in the marketplace)*  that includes IBM i Developer & Database modes, tools, workflows, skills 

### b. Install Code for IBM i Extension Pack

Install the following extensions from the VS Code Marketplace in not already installed: 

| Extension |  Purpose |
|-----------|----------|
| **IBM i Development Pack**  | Includes a set of extensions for IBM i development |

> Refer to the [**Code for IBM i documentation**](https://codefori.github.io/docs/) if you have questions.
> If you installed PPi, verify the **Bob** chat panel opens and the **IBM i Developer** and **IBM i Database** modes are available in the mode selector.

### c. Connection to IBM i

1. In Bob IDE, open the **IBM i** panel (left sidebar).
2. Click **New Connection** and enter the **host IP, user profile, and password** provided by your instructor.

- **Establish the connection to your IBM i** this is a standard connection to your IBM i. 

![alt text](pics/image-2ppi.png)  ![alt text](pics/image-4ppi.png)  ![alt text](pics/image-5ppi.png)
 
 Refer to the `Code for i` [QuickStart]((https://codefori.github.io/docs/quickstart/) for more details. 


- **(Optional) Establish an SSH tunnel when using IBM i on PVS** if you want to use a 5250 terminal session from your workstation. Only required if using IBM i on PowerVS (IBM Cloud) with a public IP. Please ask your instructor. (see instructions [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-connect-ibmi#ssh-tunneling , the instructor will share the command to run on your workstation).
- In the **Code for IBM i** object browser, browse library **`SAMSRCn`** — this contains the original source members (RPG, CL, DDS, SQL) for reference.
- Browse library **`SAMCOn`** (your team's library) — this contains compiled programs, objects, and the database.
- Launch **`GO SAMMNU`** on 5250 to explore the SAMCO application menu and understand the green-screen interface you will be modernizing.

### Library List


**Important Note**: Your job's library list must include `SAMCOx` so that compiled programs can find their files and service programs at runtime. **Ideally, in your Bob IDE, please make sure your Library List includes: `SAMCOn` , `SAMSRCn`** 


```cl
ADDLIBLE LIB(SAMCOx)    /* compiled objects — replace x with your team number */
```

Set the library list in the **Code for IBM i** connection settings under *User Library List* . If needed please refer to the [documentation](https://codefori.github.io/docs/browsers/).

## Lab Descriptions

### Lab 101 — Document SAMCO with Bob
**Mode**: 💬 Ask | **File**: [lab101-premium-discover-samco.md](lab101-premium-discover-samco.md)

Use Bob's **Ask** mode with `read_member` and `search_qsys` to read live source from the `SAMSRC` library, produce program-level and business-level documentation, and generate an architecture document with a live ERD — all saved to `docs/`.

**Premium features**: `read_member` · `search_qsys` · `/erd` · `search_ibm_i_docs_with_rag`

---

### Lab 102 — Convert Fixed-Format RPG to Free
**Mode**: ℹ️ IBM i Developer | **File**: [lab102-premium-fixed-to-free.md](lab102-premium-fixed-to-free.md)

The Premium Package adds the **`convert_rpg_source` tool** and the **Fixed to Free Conversion Workflow** — a guided multi-step process that converts each specification group in order and outputs a compile status table. Source is read from the local workspace; the converted file is written back to the workspace and compiled to `SAMCOx`.

---

### Lab 103 — Convert DDS to SQL 
**Mode**: ℹ️ IBM i Developer | **File**: [lab103-premium-dds-to-sql-workflow.md](lab103-premium-dds-to-sql-workflow.md)

The **DDS to SQL Conversion Impact Analysis** produces a full migration assessment for one DDS file before touching any code. It calls `QSYS2.GENERATE_SQL`, scans for static program references, and reports journaling, locks, and authority data as a structured impact report.

---

### Lab 104 — Convert RLA to SQL and Optimize
**Mode**: 🛢️ IBM i Database | **File**: [lab104-premium-rla-to-sql.md](lab104-premium-rla-to-sql.md)

The dedicated **IBM i Database** mode converts the `CHAIN`+`getArtFamDesc()` two-operation pattern to a single SQL `SELECT … JOIN`, optimizes with index guidance, and visualizes schema relationships with `/erd SAMCOx`.

---

### Lab 105 — Analyze Impact and Extend a Field Across the Full Stack
**Mode**: ℹ️ IBM i Developer | **File**: [lab105-premium-impact-analysis.md](lab105-premium-impact-analysis.md)

Uses the **live IBM i system catalog** (`QSYS2.SYSDEP`, `QSYS2.SYSCST`) to build a full dependency and recompile impact report for `ARTICLE` — then executes the change end-to-end: `ALTER TABLE` to widen `ARDESC`, display file update (enforcing 24×80 screen constraints), RPG program source update, and recompile of both DSPF and program targeting `SAMCOx`.

---

### Lab 106 — Generate RPGUnit Tests for SAMCO
**Mode**: ℹ️ IBM i Developer | **File**: [lab106-premium-test-rpgunit.md](lab106-premium-test-rpgunit.md)

After modernizing SAMCO code, verify correctness with automated tests. `generate_rpg_unit_test_stub` reads exported procedures from the local workspace, generates scaffold test code, and recommends a storage location. `run_rpg_unit_test_suite` compiles and executes against `SAMCOx`.

---

## IBM i Developer Mode (ℹ️)

**Purpose**: Explain, generate, compile, document, test, and modernize IBM i code.

Bob acts as an expert in RPG (OPM and ILE), CL, DDS, SQL, and COBOL. When connected, your **library list, OS version, CCSID, and home directory** are automatically injected into every conversation.

| Tool category | Tools |
|---------------|-------|
| **Read** | `read_stream_file`, `search_ifs`, `read_member` (Lab 101 only), `search_qsys` |
| **Edit** | `write_stream_file` (local workspace) |
| **Execute** | `execute_cl_command`, `execute_sql_statement`, `check_sql_syntax`, `execute_pase_command` |
| **Build** | `get_compile_actions`, `execute_compile_action` |
| **Test** | `generate_rpg_unit_test_stub`, `run_rpg_unit_test_suite` |
| **Docs** | `fetch_cl_command_doc`, `search_sql_examples`, `fetch_sql_example`, `search_ibm_i_docs_with_rag` |

> **Guardrails**: Destructive CL (`DLT*`, `CHG*`, `CPY*`) and destructive SQL (`DROP`, `DELETE`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`) require explicit user approval.

---

## IBM i Database Mode (🛢️)

**Purpose**: Generate, modernize, and tune SQL within Db2 for i.

**Used in**: [Lab 104](lab104-premium-rla-to-sql.md)

A database-expert mode focused on Db2 for i — SQL-first, with full awareness of DDS and CL realities. Includes all the same tools as IBM i Developer mode.

---

## Slash Commands

### `/erd` — Generate an Entity Relationship Diagram

```
/erd SAMCOx
/erd SAMCOx.ARTICLE
```

Queries the `QSYS2` catalog and generates a **Mermaid ERD** showing tables, columns, primary keys, and relationships. Available in both IBM i modes when connected.

**Used in**: [Lab 101](lab101-premium-discover-samco.md) · [Lab 104](lab104-premium-rla-to-sql.md)

---

## Workflows (non exhaustive list)


### Workflow 1 — Fixed to Free Conversion

Guided conversion of **fixed-format RPG to free-format RPG IV** — specification by specification (H→`Ctl-Opt`, F→`Dcl-F`, D→`Dcl-S`/`Dcl-Ds`, C→free-form), with a compile status table at the end.

**Used in**: [Lab 102](lab102-premium-fixed-to-free.md)
